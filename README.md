# Fancy Counter Vite

A simple, yet elegant, counter app built with **Vite** and **React** that demonstrates how easy and fast it is to build modern web apps using the Vite toolchain. This project is designed to showcase the efficiency of Vite for quick development and easy setup of React applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Counter**: A fully functioning counter that can be incremented, decremented, and reset.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and minimalistic design to ensure the user interface is simple yet appealing.
- **Fast Development**: With Vite's hot module replacement and fast build time, the app allows rapid development.
- **React Setup**: Utilizes React, leveraging its component-based structure for easy scaling and maintenance.

## Tools & Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Utilized here for creating the counter components.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and more optimized development experience compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the app with a clean and responsive design.
